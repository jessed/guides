# Motivation
Most people know Bash as the most common command line shell environment used on Linux (and most other \*nix) operating systems. Most people use Bash with whatever default options are configured with the distribution, but it is capable of much, much more. The purpose of this guide is to expose you to some Bash's more advanced capabilities. This is by no means an exhaustive exploration of Bash's capabilities, but I've attempted to cover some of the more useful options that don't require an extensive knowledge of Bash to utilize.

## Organization
This guide is broken into small-ish parts in order to allow you to review specific topics in isolation of the others. There is no need to review [Functions]() if [Aliases]() is all you are interested in; they are separate, unrelated topics and can be reviewed as such. I urge to you review the section on Initialization either way, as that section applies to both functions and aliases.

## Sections
1. [Invocation / Initialization]()
2. [Aliases]()
3. [Functions]()
4. [Prompt]()
5. [SSH]()
