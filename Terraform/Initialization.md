# Initialization: `terraform init`
When you run `terraform init` Terraform will read all of the configuration files in your current directory and download all of the required *providers* for you. These will be placed in a directory called `.terraform/providers/...`. It will also identify every [module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary#module) used in your configuration and write the list to `.terraform/modules/modules.json`.

When you run `terraform init` Terraform reads every file that ends with `.tf` in the current directory and looks for a block called  `terraform`, which contains a sub-block called `required_providers`. The `required_providers` block contains a list of every 3rd party "provider" required by your terraform configuration. It does not need to include default terraform providers - only 3rd party providers that provide additional functionality.

## Important Take-away
The first thing to understand here is that, other than the Terraform package itself, **nothing is manually downloaded**. Terraform will automatically download the components it requires when it is *initialized*. (I spent a humiliating amount of time figuring this out.) The second thing to understand is that Terraform initialization *is not the first step* in creating a new plan/deployment. Counter-intuitively, terraform initialization takes place after you've written all of the code and right before you actually try to run the plan to do something. 

Note: Running `terraform init` does not verify that your code is without flaws or actually does anything at all. It *does* perform a basic syntax check, but that's it.
