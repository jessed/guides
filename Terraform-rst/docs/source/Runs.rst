Run
===
A Terraform `Run <https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary#run>`_ consists of one or more `Resources <https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary#resource>`_. Resources are what will actually happen when you enter `terraform apply` to deploy your configuration.

Terraform `Resources <https://www.terraform.io/docs/glossary#resource>`_ are blocks of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) elements. These define what the deployment *should* be and leave it up to the Terraform logic and the provider to make happen. While several aspects of Terraform seem quite similar to a programming language, what you are actually "coding" is how things should be. When you run `terraform apply`, you are telling Terraform to make them that way.
